# Title:  Mobile Phone 📱

Description:

📌 A mobile phone is a wireless handheld device that allows users to make and receive calls. While the earliest generation of mobile phones could only make and receive calls, today’s mobile phones do a lot more, accommodating web browsers, games, cameras, video players and navigational systems.

📌 Also, while mobile phones used to be mainly known as “cell phones” or cellular phones, today’s mobile phones are more commonly called “smartphones” because of all of the extra voice and data services that they offer.


## ❓FAQS❓

#### Do cell phones give off (emit) radiation?

Yes, cell phones and cordless phones use radiofrequency radiation (RF) to send signals. RF is different from other types of radiation (like x-rays) that we know can be harmful. We don’t know for sure if RF radiation from cell phones can cause health problems years later. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified RF radiation as a “possible human carcinogen.” (A carcinogen is an agent that causes cancer).

#### What other bad things are there about mobile phones?

High cell phone usage can have negative effects on our health. Researchers have found that excessive phone usage leads to stress, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, and relationship issues. Studies have also shown that young people experience withdrawal symptoms when away from their phone for a short period of time. There are many negative effects, but rather than focusing on all the bad things, our goal is to give you some tools on how to improve and experience a clearer mind and better relationships


#### Does a mobile phone necessary for students?

Mobile phones serve many important functions. Digital literacy is a critical aspect of young people’s schooling and research shows mobile phones can play a role in supporting such learning. It's important students learn with these devices so they can effectively participate in the workforce.
